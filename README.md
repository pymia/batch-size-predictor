# machine learning model predictor
- a. clone this repo and put `train_cases.csv` under this folder

- b. `python predict_ml.py path/to/my/test_file.csv`

- c. receive latest prediction file `result.csv` under this folder 

# NN model predictor

- a. clone this repo and put `train_cases.csv` under this folder

- b. `python predict_ml.py path/to/my/test_file.csv`

- c. receive latest prediction file `result.csv` and `my_model.h5` under this folder
